The base jump (running horizontal) for the average man of 5'10'' is equal to 50'' + (2 x St bonus in inches). For every 2 inches above or below this average height, add or subtract one from the base jump. The difficulties listed below assume that the character is running at a dash at the time of takeoff. For every speed category (fast sprint/sprint/run/etc.) below the dash rate, raise the difficulty of the running jump by one (e.g., hard becomes very hard, etc.). The base jump (standing horizontal) for the average man of 5'10'' is equal to the base jump (running horizontal) divided by two. The base jump (running vertical) for the average man of 5'10'' is equal to (12 + St bonus) in inches. For every 3 inches above or below this average height, add or subtract one inch from the base jump. The optimal speed for a vertical jump with a running start is a run. The base jump (standing vertical) for the average man of 5'10'' is equal to the base jump (running vertical) divided by 3."

Note that this skill requires a great deal of practice and exercise to develop properly, and will increase the musculature of the individual. The use of this skill requires a round of preparation, during which only 10% activity may be performed and the individual’s DB is reduced to zero."
