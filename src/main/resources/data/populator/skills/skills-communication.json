Special creatures (e.g., the Chicken People) might cause a penalty to be added to the character’s bonus due to distinct lack of lips. Line of sight must be maintained with the subject’s mouth. Skill is halved for reading the lips of creatures not of the same general type. Types: Human, Reptile, Avian, Non-Human Mammalian, etc."
