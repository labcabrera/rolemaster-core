        "description": "This skill is the ability to make a very precise melee attack. To use his Ambush skill a character must approach his foe undetected and be able to strike before the foe can react. An attack is then made normally, and an Ambush static maneuver is made (0% activity) and modified by target’s alertness and other factors (e.g., position, lighting, etc.). If the Ambush static maneuver is successful, the character may modify his result on the resulting critical strike roll. This modification consists of being allowed to adjust the critical strike roll by any number up to the Ambush skill rank (not bonus) of the attacker. This adjustment may be either up or down. Note that to use this bonus, the attacker must first get a normal critical strike result on an attack table. If he does, however, this ability greatly increases the chance of a killing or incapacitating blow and tremendously increases the chance of a result that takes effect instantly. Since position is relatively unpredictable in a general melee situation, Ambush skill rank is halved if an ambushed foe is in a melee situation. (Note: You must still approach the foe undetected and strike before he can react.) If a “Large” or “Super-large” creature is ambushed, the Ambush skill rank is added (never subtracted) to the critical roll. If the resulting modified roll is above 95, a second roll is made and added to the modified critical as in a normal open-ended roll."
