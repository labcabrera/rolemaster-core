But the native Sindarin became far more common in everyday speech. In the Second Age and especially in the Third Age, Quenya in Middle-earth was used more as a scientific and ritual language. Because of this Tolkien sometimes called Quenya the Elf-Latin."

Instead, they use other names when talking to the other peoples of Middle-earth. The dwarven \"nicknames\" that appear in the books are all taken from Norse mythology. Besides the spoken language, called aglab, Khuzdûl had the iglishmek, which was a sign language."
