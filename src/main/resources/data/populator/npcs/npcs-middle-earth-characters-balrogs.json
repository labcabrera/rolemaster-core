			"Strength: enables the balrog to toss ant pole arm up to 100' without range penalty. He can throw rocks (up to 100lbs) up to 200'",
			"Fligth: The Fire Demon can fly up to 240 feet per round, but it takes 1-5 rounds to develop lift and take to the air. He is also a cumbersome flyer. The first round of fligth he can move up to 60'; during the second round he can move up to 120'; the third round he can move up to 180'; and the fourth and following rounds he can move up to his maximum of 240'.",
			"Inmolation: As a Fire Spririt, the Balrog is immune to fire and can inmmolate at will, even in mid-round. When completely immersed (not doused) in waterm however, his flames go out, leaving his slimy surface exposed. When he is not of fire he does not deliver any Heat criticals.",
			"Presence: The Balrog makes a RR versus an 18th level Fear spell. With a RR failure of 01-50 the victim flees in fear for 1-10 minutes. If the RR failure is 51-199 the victim is frozen in place for 1-10 rounds. Should they fail by 101+ hey die of frigth. Note that victims get a +10 bonus if the Demon is not in flames.",
			"Domination: The Balrog can direct his gaze upon ant one individual (within 300') in order to dominate fe poor fool."
