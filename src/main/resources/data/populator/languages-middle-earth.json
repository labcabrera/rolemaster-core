Because of this Tolkien sometimes called Quenya the Elf-Latin."

There is no record of a distinct hobbit language, and Hobbits have apparently always relied on nearby by Mannish tongues. This adoption of the Common speech is indicative of their subtle adaptability, for the whole of the tribes abandoned the original Kuduk tongue when they migrated out of Rhovanion in the 13th and 14th centuries of the Third Age."
