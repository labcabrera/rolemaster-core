The GM should use this skill to allow characters a chance to notice objects, events, and other phenomena around them. Note that the use of this skill assumes that the character has not indicated that he is looking for such a thing. If the player is actively seeking something within the environment, the appropriate Awareness • Searching skill should be used. The existence of this as a skill indicates one’s ability to train sensitivity to such things, but more active observation should be handled by the skills of Observation and Situational Awareness."

This is normally only usable in an active fashion, and requires concentration. Note that this skill is different from Alertness, which represents a general and unconscious level of receptivity and awareness of events and details within one's immediate environment. This skill reflects the active observation, noting and appraisal of such details. For example, if a character were about to make camp in an unsafe location, the GM might make an Alertness static maneuver for that character to determine whether or not he notices the danger. If the character indicated that he wished to examine the location for suitability, the character would instead make an Observation static maneuver."
